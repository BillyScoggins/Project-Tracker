# Project
Daily Scheduler

# # This project is a daily scheduler that provides the current day and date as well as color coding the current, past, and future times, allowing the user to see what they scheduled by the hour.

The motivation for building this project was to allow the user to schedule their day by the hour to keep the day organized.

I built this project as a way of helping people structure their day so as to avoid either trying to schedule too much in an hour, or scheduling too little in an hour. It functions as a means of being efficient with time management.

I learned about using jQuery and how it works in coordination with JavaScript.
