# Project - Work Day Planner

## Description - I created this scheduler as a way of tracking my days work activities for each hour

My motivation for creating the scheduler was to make my day easier and more organized by being able to schedule my time by hour.

I built this project to allow me to see in advance what I had scheduled for the day and make sure that i stayed cognizant of time management.

The scheduler solves the problem of falling behind during the day since I can now see what I have to do each hour and can manage my time more effectively.

I learned about jQuery and how it is utilized inside of JavaScript.
